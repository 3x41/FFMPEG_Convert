## Notes

:grey_exclamation: :cinema: **You need to have FFMPEG installed**, you can download it from:
https://ffmpeg.org/

Currently **only for Windows OS**, Although Linux version will be available at a later date.

## How to use:

At the command line or powershell, CD into the folder where the videos are.

Then run the batch file. So for example, your videos are in a folder C:\TMP

> CD \
> CD TMP

Then run the batch file where ever you have saved it too, for example.

> C:\TOOLS\FFMPEG\Convert.bat

You can then select an option to run and this will convert the all videos in the folder.

Enjoy !
